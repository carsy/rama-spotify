RAMA is a Spotify Application for visualizing and interacting with networks of music artists. For the original RAMA web application see [rama.inescporto.pt]

Here are some previews of what this app does:

![Demo](demo2.gif)
![Demo 2](demo.gif)

For now, I do not intend to make this application available on the Spotify App Store, so to run it you need to set it up first.

To open a downloaded app you need to **Activate Spotify Developer account** here: https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account (no premium account needed).

I've tested the app in mac, windows and linux. Please report any [issues] you encounter please.

Installation
--------------

#### Automagic installer (mac and linux only)

Execute the installer script.

```sh
$ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carsy/rama-spotify/master/install.sh | bash
```

You should now be in the app and seeing a graph thingy.
If not, restart Spotify and then open the app by typing spotify:app:rama in the search bar.

#### Manual installer (windows, mac and linux)

These are the contents of the script:

```sh
$ mkdir ~/Spotify ; cd ~/Spotify
$ rm -rf rama
$ rm rama_v1.0.1.tar.gz
$ curl -L -O https://github.com/carsy/rama-spotify/releases/download/v1.0.1/rama_v1.0.1.tar.gz
$ tar -xvf rama_v1.0.1.tar.gz
```

You should now be in the app and seeing a graph thingy.

If not, restart Spotify (open the app by typing spotify:app:rama in the search bar).

Alternatively, If you happen to have commandlinephobia (I get that every other month... might be a thing):

1. download the latest version of the app from [here]
2. extract the folder
3. create the Spotify folder if it doesn't exist already: "~/Spotify" (Mac OS X) or "My Documents\Spotify" (Windows).
4. copy the extracted folder to the Spotify folder.

Now open Spotify and type in the search bar:
```sh
spotify:app:rama
```

You should now be in the app and seeing a graph thingy.

If not, restart Spotify and then open the app by typing spotify:app:rama in the search bar.

Thank you for testing!
